QUESTION 1: Letâ€™s sabotage some of our code. Remove the opening curly bracket, {, from the function. 
Refresh the page. Is the error message that is now produced useful? Why or why not?

The error message produced is "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'var.' The error message that is produced is 
helpful because it points out that there is something wrong with a variable.

QUESTION 2: Put back in the curly bracket. Change the name of the function that you call 
to have a different name then the actual function that we made. Click refresh. 
Is there a new error message? Click the button to run the function. Is there a new error message now?
Is the message helpful?

The error message produced is "Uncaught SyntaxError: Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined
at HTMLButtonElement.onclick." The error message is different from the first error message. The error message is
helpful because it points out that the function being called does not have a function written for it.


QUESTION 3: Fix the problem and this time change the name of your variable. 
What error message is produced now? Is it helpful?
The error message produced is Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined at myFunction (as3.html:14:45) 
at HTMLButtonElement.onclick. The error message is helpful as it shows that the variable is not
defined correctly.

QUESTION 4: What would happen if we did not parse the variables? If you are not sure, 
try running the equation without parsing the variables first. 
What would happen if we would need to add the variables instead?

If variables are not parsed, then arithmetic functions do not give the correct output. If variables need to be added,
they would jsut be concatenated instead of being added together.

QUESTION 5: What would be the difference if we used integer vs float, or vice versa?

Integers store whole numbers while float stores decimals.
